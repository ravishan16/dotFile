## Guides (Published via mdBook)

The detailed guides for installation, tool usage (Brew, Git, Docker, Conda, Rust, etc.), and macOS tips are maintained in the `/docs` directory and automatically published as an online book using `mdBook` and GitHub Pages.

**ðŸ“š [Access the Online Guides Here](https://ravishan16.github.io/dotFile/)** You can also build and view the guides locally:
1. Ensure you have Rust and `mdbook` installed (the setup script `09_install_rust.sh` handles this).
2. Navigate to the repository root directory.
3. Run `mdbook serve --open`.
